# Routine Maker Backend

## Project Objectives

The backend part of the project aims to implement the logic and services necessary for generating personalized study schedules for students using the Routine Planner Feature. The backend should efficiently process student preferences and constraints to create optimized study routines.

## Architecture Overview

The backend architecture is designed to handle the business logic of routine generation and communication with the frontend. Key components and features include:

- **Routine Generation Service**: Logic for generating study routines based on user preferences.
- **API Endpoints**: Exposes endpoints for the frontend to send and receive data related to student preferences and generated study schedules.
- **Database Integration**: Integrates with a database to store and retrieve relevant information.
- **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication, ensuring secure access to routine generation features.

### Key Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web application framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user preferences and generated routines.
- **Zod Validator**: For input validation and sanitization.
- **Routine Generation Algorithm**: Implement a suitable algorithm for generating study routines based on student preferences.

## Usage Instructions

To use the backend for the Routine Planner Feature, follow these steps:

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js and the chosen database (MongoDB) installed.
2. **Installation**: Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

### Database Configuration

- Set up the database connection in the appropriate configuration file.
- Create the necessary collections or tables for storing user data.

### Running the Application

- Run `npm dev` to start the backend server in development mode.
